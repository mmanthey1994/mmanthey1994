Instructions On Reproducing Thesis Results:
1. Unfortunately the raw IGRA2 data are too large to upload here. The Tasmanian Data is given here however. Download the IGRA2 data from: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00975
2. To reproduce results for the Tasmanian data, simply run the relevant file once data has been placed in the working directory etc. For the IGRA2 data, once this is downloaded, processing is done via two script files in R - called Step 1 and Step 2. The simulation study is a standalone script file.
